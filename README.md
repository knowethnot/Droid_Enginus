Droid Engine Remake:

	- Featuring the illustrious EGL & GLESv2
	- Attempting port GLESv3 and SLES ...(maybe Vulkan when the gets better at android ndk)
	- Currently working on the Component system along with lighting
	- The mathematics side of programming is quite fun to visualize but embedded modulation is sick
	- Anyone who feels like modifying the engine feel free definetly will be doing such
